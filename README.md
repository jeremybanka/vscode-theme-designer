## Description

This is an online tool to create VS Code themes. To use it, you'll have to have [vsce](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension) installed.

- See your changes live as you make them.
- When you're done, click "Export".
- Copy the output text into two files in the same folder called `package.json` and `*****-color-theme.json` where `*****` is the name you picked but in `lower-kebab-case`.
- Run `$ vsce package` in this folder. Say 'y' if it asks you anything.
- Right click the `vsix` file and click "Install Extension VSIX"
- Then, go to your Extensions tab, find your newly-installed theme, and Set Color Theme. Remember to click it again when it previews.
- If there's an error at this point, it's probably because your theme filename is slightly off.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

#### Resources

- [Packaging an extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension)
- [Example Themes](https://github.com/jeremybanka/vscode_themes)
- [Token Reference](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color)
- [How to Inspect VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide#scope-inspector)

#### First Things First

- Clone this repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/jeremybanka/vscode-theme-designer`
- Get things installed: `$ npm i`
- Get things built: `$ npm run start`
- This should prompt your browser to open the project on 8080. It's actually pointed at the dist folder, and will update live.

#### ESLint/Prettier Tooling

- Use VS Code.
- Install VS Code extension "ESLint" by Dirk Baeumer.
- Install VS Code extension "Prettier"
- Ensure that your VS Code settings.json has the following properties set:
  ```
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": true
  }
  ```
- Now, my meticulously selected formatting preferences will be applied to files in this repo any time you hit save!
